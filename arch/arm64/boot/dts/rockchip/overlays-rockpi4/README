Introduction
=============

This directory contains Device Tree overlays. Device Tree makes it possible
to support many hardware configurations with a single kernel and without the
need to explicitly load or blacklisr kernel modules.

On Rock Pi, you will find a .dtb for each base platform in /boot. This
describes the hardware that is part of the Rock Pi board. The loader selects
the .dtb file appropriate for the platform by name and pass it to the kernel.

Device Tree Overlays usage is controlled from /boot/hw_intfc.conf. You can do
the settings for Rock Pi in your hw_intfc.conf, which should cause your
Rock Pi to do your wanted things after a reboot.

In /boot/overlays you will find many .dtbo files. The loader will merge the
selected .dtbo files by reading file /boot/hw_intfc.conf.


Using Overlays
===============

Overlays are loaded using "intfc:" directive. As an example, consider the
at24c02 module. Add one line in hw_intfc.conf:

	intfc:dtoverlay=at24c02

This causes the file /boot/overlays/at24c02.dtbo to be loaded.

N.B. It is recommended to only ebable those bus interfaces that are needed.
Leaving all interfaces enabled can lead to unwanted behaviour.


Name:   at24c02
Info:   Overlay for activation of Atmel AT24C02 over I2C
Load:   intfc:dtoverlay=at24c02


Name:   two-color-led
Info:   Overlay for activation of two color led module.
Load:   intfc:dtoverlay=two-color-led


Name:   console-on-ttyS2
Info:   By default, fiq debugger console is disabled.
        When this dtbo file is loaded, Rock Pi enables fiq debugger console.
        ttyS2 Pins will output console information.
        At the same time, it is recommended that you set UART2 to off in
        file /boot/hw_intfc.conf and do not load console-on-ttyS4.dtbo file.
Load:   intfc:dtoverlay=console-on-ttyS2


Name:   console-on-ttyS4
Info:   By default, fiq debugger console is disabled.
        When this dtbo file is loaded, Rock Pi enables fiq debugger console.
        ttyS4 Pins will output console information.
        At the same time, it is recommended that you set UART4 to off in
        file /boot/hw_intfc.conf and do not load console-on-ttyS2.dtbo file.
Load:   intfc:dtoverlay=console-on-ttyS4
